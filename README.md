# Markov-Decision-Processes-Lab  AI _ lab

* This lab show how agent go to the goal state which have maximum value with smallest moves.
* r is the maximum reward .
* The problem statement is:
![problem statement description](./problemExplanation.png).

* The requirement is : 
![requirement statement description](./requirement.png).

* After try r=100 the result of value and process iteration is :
![result at r=100](./At r=100.png).


* After try r=-1 the result of value and process iteration is :
![result at r=-1](./At r=-1.png).
